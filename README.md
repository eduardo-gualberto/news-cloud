# About the project

A modern, minimalistic way to visualize the world news.

The focus of the project is to showcase its Clean Code + Domain Driven Design implementation in a declarative/functional environment such as a React (Native) project, which can be challenging.

Using Clean Code and DDD offers many benefits, like:

- SOLID principles made possible: it allows you to more intuitively follow some of the best practices out there. As an example, the single responsibility principle is really hard to adopt using reducers and the more common state management libs, but the project gives an alternative way using Preact Signals and the Context API
- Easier to navigate the project: since its organization and logic are pretty simple and well documented, it's going to be easier to find where to look when incidents happen, and simpler to extend an app's functionalities
- Estimates can be more accurate: since much complexity is removed by adopting DDD + Clean Code, less sudden complications should occur, improving the teams ability to foresee its work.
